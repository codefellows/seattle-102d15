Review of CSS

Easi(er)
- Colors are pretty easy
  - Background
  - Font color
  Changes to the Nav Bar
    Rounded corners
    Use ID's to speficy and target (used on the images)
    borders were a bit easier
    


Difficult:
 - Positioning
 - Getting image into HTML file was difficult
 - Some command overrrite others


 Tags Targeted:
 - body
 - nav
 - li
 - heading
 - img
 - id

     border: solid red 1px;
 }

 id 1 times use

     width: 600px;
