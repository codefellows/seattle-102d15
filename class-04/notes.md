# Summary of Learning from Class 3

GitHub Workflow
 - Make sure you have the most current version (Your local computer is at the HEAD of your repo)
 - Open code editor
 - Make the changes to do the thing!
 - Save in the editor
 - Command to run
    - git status
    - git add filename or .
    - git status
    - git commit -m "commit messaage" note you can use " " or ' '
    - git status
    - git push origin master

Initial Thoughts?
 - Really cool to do in code editor and see online.
 - Like seeing with without using the GUI
 - Mistakes can be fixed because you can go back to previous versions.
 - More challenging that initially thought.
